      cardDetailedText: `A plate of berries typically consists of a vibrant and colorful assortment of fresh berries, such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. The berries are usually washed and arranged attractively on a plate, highlighting their natural hues and textures. This mix provides a delightful combination of flavors, ranging from the sweetness of strawberries to the tartness of raspberries. The presentation is both appetizing and visually appealing, making it a perfect addition to a breakfast spread, a healthy snack, or a refreshing dessert. The berries are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber, offering a nutritious and delicious treat.`,

      cardDetailedText: `The board is filled with an array of mathematical equations, each representing significant concepts. Among them are the elegant simplicity of \( E = mc^2 \), the foundational \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \), and the intricate beauty of the Riemann Hypothesis's \( \zeta(s) = 0 \). Interspersed are calculus integrals, complex numbers in Euler's formula \( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \), and statistical representations like \( \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x - \mu)^2}{N}} \). The mix of symbols, numbers, and variables illustrates the profound interconnectedness of mathematical theory, evoking a sense of discovery and intellectual challenge.`,
